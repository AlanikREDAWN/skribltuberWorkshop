# skribltuberWorkshop

This project was started in the Hack Club ScribbleTuber workshop hosted by Max. I thought it might be cool to add a control board with sound effects, so I went ahead and did that. However, I’m still in the middle of implementing that part. Here’s the link to the live site, hosted on Nest: <https://scribbletuber.kittycat.hackclub.app/>
